## Independent-set
a program to generate sets and find the largest independent subset using genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.
# how to run:
download sets or generate sets with gen_sets.py.

for gen_alg or sim_anneal change the set_size and file name as appropriate (if 50 nodes, filename should be set to '50' and set_size to 50)

parameters such as initial temperature should be changed as wanted to optimize convergence.
